## Connecting

### Linux Servers
   
You should have access to any of our public servers from within the departmental network. For example

```
ssh shell4.doc.ic.ac.uk
ssh cccad1
```

If your account has just been created we advise that you change the
default password (which you will have received in a separate e-mail).

If you are using any graphical utilities (e.g. MaxIDE), then you
must '''enable X forwarding (-X)''':

```
ssh -X shell4.doc.ic.ac.uk
ssh -X cccad1
```

### Windows Servers

DoC runs a Windows server that anyone can login to using remote
desktop (RDP), with, most importantly, MS Office.

It's officially documented here: https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/csg/guides/remoteaccess/wints

To login use

```
rdesktop -z -u <USERNAME> -d WIN -g 1280x1024 ts
```

__Note__:

  1. the domain is "WIN" (alternatively, prefix your username with "WIN\<USERNAME>")
  2. AFAIK this ts server is only accessible within IC, so you have to go through shell

### Using X2Go

You can create a virtual, local display on the remote server to which your software can run on. This is reliable, since everything runs locally on the build machine.

You need to first download X2Go client on your local machine:
https://wiki.x2go.org

The package is available on Windows, Linux and Mac.

After the installation, you have to create a local profile with the following steps:
1. Click `Session` -> `New session`.
2. Put the hostname of the remote server that you want to connect to, such as `cccad2.doc.ic.ac.uk` as `Host`.
3. Put your userID as `Login`.
4. Select `XFCE` as `Session type`.
5. Click `OK`.

Then you can connect to the remote machine by doubling the profile. It should prompt for your CC group passwor

Note that this connection only works if you are in the College network.
